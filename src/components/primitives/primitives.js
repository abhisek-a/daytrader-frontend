              The Geronimo performance benchmark sample provides a suite of web primitives. These primitives singularly test key operations in the enterprise Java programming model. Links to each of the web primitive tests are provided below along with a description of each operation.
              <br />Note that some primitives below can have their main operations repeated. These operations are marked with a red *. In order to adjust the repetition, change the primitive iteration value in the Trade configuration page.
